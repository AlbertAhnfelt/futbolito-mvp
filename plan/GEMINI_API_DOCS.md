Here is some official API which states how to implement the things i mentioned:

https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?example=recipe
- Parse into .json formating via this:

JSON schema support
To generate a JSON object, set the response_mime_type in the generation configuration to application/json and provide a response_json_schema. The schema must be a valid JSON Schema that describes the desired output format.

The model will then generate a response that is a syntactically valid JSON string matching the provided schema. When using structured outputs, the model will produce outputs in the same order as the keys in the schema.

Gemini's structured output mode supports a subset of the JSON Schema specification.

The following values of type are supported:

string: For text.
number: For floating-point numbers.
integer: For whole numbers.
boolean: For true/false values.
object: For structured data with key-value pairs.
array: For lists of items.
null: To allow a property to be null, include "null" in the type array (e.g., {"type": ["string", "null"]}).
These descriptive properties help guide the model:

title: A short description of a property.
description: A longer and more detailed description of a property.
Type-specific properties
For object values:

properties: An object where each key is a property name and each value is a schema for that property.
required: An array of strings, listing which properties are mandatory.
additionalProperties: Controls whether properties not listed in properties are allowed. Can be a boolean or a schema.
For string values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible strings for classification tasks.
format: Specifies a syntax for the string, such as date-time, date, time.
For number and integer values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible numeric values.
minimum: The minimum inclusive value.
maximum: The maximum inclusive value.
For array values:

items: Defines the schema for all items in the array.
prefixItems: Defines a list of schemas for the first N items, allowing for tuple-like structures.
minItems: The minimum number of items in the array.
maxItems: The maximum number of items in the array.

- You can start generating responses while it is working:

Streaming
You can stream structured outputs, which allows you to start processing the response as it's being generated, without having to wait for the entire output to be complete. This can improve the perceived performance of your application.

The streamed chunks will be valid partial JSON strings, which can be concatenated to form the final, complete JSON object.

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal

class Feedback(BaseModel):
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "neutral", "negative"]
    summary: str

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "The new UI is incredibly intuitive and visually appealing. Great job. Add a very long summary to test streaming!"

response_stream = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents=prompt,
    config={
        "response_mime_type": "application/json",
        "response_json_schema": Feedback.model_json_schema(),
    },
)

for chunk in response_stream:
    print(chunk.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text)

- Some best practises:

Best practices
Clear descriptions: Use the description field in your schema to provide clear instructions to the model about what each property represents. This is crucial for guiding the model's output.
Strong typing: Use specific types (integer, string, enum) whenever possible. If a parameter has a limited set of valid values, use an enum.
Prompt engineering: Clearly state in your prompt what you want the model to do. For example, "Extract the following information from the text..." or "Classify this feedback according to the provided schema...".
Validation: While structured output guarantees syntactically correct JSON, it does not guarantee the values are semantically correct. Always validate the final output in your application code before using it.
Error handling: Implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully manage cases where the model's output, while schema-compliant, may not meet your business logic requirements.
Limitations
Schema subset: Not all features of the JSON Schema specification are supported. The model ignores unsupported properties.
Schema complexity: The API may reject very large or deeply nested schemas. If you encounter errors, try simplifying your schema by shortening property names, reducing nesting, or limiting the number of constraints.

- You can have video offset (meta-data):

Set clipping intervals
You can clip video by specifying videoMetadata with start and end offsets.

Python
JavaScript

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='models/gemini-2.5-flash',
    contents=types.Content(
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                file_data=types.FileData(file_uri='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEzRZ35urlk'),
                video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(
                    start_offset='1250s',
                    end_offset='1570s'
                )
            ),
            types.Part(text='Please summarize the video in 3 sentences.')
        ]
    )
)
